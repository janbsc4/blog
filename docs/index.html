<p><h2><a href="/blog/posts/cucumbers">The exciting lives of cucumbers</a></h2>
<p>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family that bears cucumiform fruits, which are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market. In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related.</p>

<p><h2><a href="/blog/posts/mango/">Mango Time</a></h2>
<p>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the &quot;Indian type&quot; and the &quot;Southeast Asian type&quot;. Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called &quot;mangoes&quot;, the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.</p>
