I'm a German-Spanish human beeing from Barcelona. I've been living in Berlin since 2015 and loving it.

Coming from a business background, I'm an (increasingly) technical marketer and SEO. I recently developed a SEO oriented content plan and lead a major UX focused website redesign.

Currently I'm learning web development and building this website as a learning project.
